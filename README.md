# Fileecho purger
This software is designed to purge old files from Fidonet fileechoes. Same functionality can be achieved with `find` wrapped in some simple `bash` script, but these tools were not available on Windows at the time this software was created. Releasing it here mostly for historical reasons.

All text files are in CP866 charset.
